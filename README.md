# SonarDepthPlugin
This plugin enables the ability to visualize sonar depth in real time.


Currently, the following features are enabled:
* Plot colored breadcrumb that is associated to a specific depth as rover moves along its path
* Allow the operator to dynamically readjust the max sonar depth value to be plotted
* Allow for refreshing of color values in real time if max sonar depth was changed
